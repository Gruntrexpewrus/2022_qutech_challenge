Just some nice dudes and a lady

File setup.ipynb (jupyter notebook) has instructions on how to use Quantum Inspire for the challenge!

So we are:
- Leonardo Placidi
- Alessandro Summer
- Lisa Bombieri
- Andrea Maiani
- Ciro Gus Salcedo


We chose to work on the Quantum Key Distribution challenge. We split up into two groups: one working on the classical end and another on the quantum. On the classical end, we had a task brand new to all of us, network programming. We decided to implement our system as a chatroom where the two users could talk to each other classically and each user had a personal server for sending quantum information to the quantum computer. We underestimated the complexity of this task as the network code was difficult to produce in the first place, given our experience. The challenge ended around when we were working on integrating the classical and quantum system. On the quantum end, we replicated the BB84 and E91 algorithm and developed a format from sending classical instructions from the users to the quantum interface.
