#### WELCOME TO THE GITHUB GUIDE
#Step 1
-Fork the original repo to your own GITHUB; that's done on the website
-Now you will bring your fork into your local machine
git clone --my repo link--
-Set the upstream of your forked repo to the original repo
git remote upstream --original repository--
-update the local machine with the original repository
git pull upstream main

#Step 2
-create a new branch to work in
git branch new-branch
-switch into that branch
git checkout new-branch

Step 3
-Write your code and make all your changes
-Stage your changes and commit them
git add . #this adds all files that were changed to the staging area
git commit -m "TITLE" -m "Describe what you did"

Step 4
-Merge your branch and your forked repo
git checkout main
git merge new-branch
-fix any conflicts typically by just accepting current changes
-now update your repo
git add . 
git commit #this will automatically describe the merge
git push origin main

Step 5
-Push everything to the original GITHUB
-go to your own github page and look at your forked repo
-create a pull request and follow through with the website's instructions
-once your pull request is accepted, it's done!
